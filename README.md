# SAGE AGI Library
SAGE AGI Library is a library of Haxe code for working with Sierra AGI games.

# Recommended Development Setup
The standard environment used for development is as follows:
* [Haxe 4.0.0-rc2](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.0.0-rc.2/) - theoretically this should work with any newer version of Haxe.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Haxe Extension Pack (for vscode, recommended rather than installing individual extensions)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vshaxe.haxe-extension-pack)
* [Haxe Checkstyle (for vscode)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vshaxe.haxe-checkstyle)

Included is a standard build.hxml for Intellisense, and debugging configuration, but debugging may need to be configured for your system.
